Hey there! Welcome to my personal site. Previously, I worked on the Robotics team at OpenAI focused on simulation, control, and generalizable robotic platforms. During my Ph.D, I worked on the development of high endurance solar powered and shapeshifting UAVs, and before that I worked on custom automation for tissue heart valves at medical device companies.

**Education:**
- **University of Minnesota**
<br />- Ph.D. Mechanical Engineering (2013 - 2019)
<br />- M.S. Electrical Engineering (2015 - 2017)
<br />- B.M.E Mechanical Engineering (2009 - 2013)

**Interests:** Simulation, robotics, control & estimation, machine learning.
