## Solar UAV-Large

<img align="left" width="700" height="700" src="/images/suavl_indoor.png">
The purpose of this project was to explore the development of a hand-launchable fixed-wing UAV capable of day-long and multi-day flight through the use of solar-power. My primary contributions were related to power electronics architecture and design, avionics.

## Transformer UAV

The Transformer UAV project demonstrates a first-of-a-kind shapeshifting based vertical-takeoff-and-landing UAV. The inspiration for this pursuit stems from designing a UAV that combines the efficiency of fixed-wing flight with the manuvarability of multi-rotor flight. Combined with the energy surplus associated with solar-powered flight yielded a unique and rich research pursuit. Protoypes are named MultI-Section-Transformable (MIST)-UAV.

## Sim-to-real Transformer UAV

While classical control techniques were used to successfully perform multiple transformations, many airframes were crashed in the process of testing controllers. A pursuit I am exploring is the use of reinforcement learning in controlling systems with challenging and unobservable dynamics.
