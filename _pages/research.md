One of the core goals of this work was to push the capabilities of sim-to-real dexterity by growing environment complexity purely in simulation. The entropy of these environments was managed through the use of the implicit curriculum learning generated by Automatic Domain Randomization.

## Solar UAV-Large

The purpose of this project was to explore the development of a hand-launchable fixed-wing UAV capable of day-long and multi-day flight through the use of solar-power. My primary contributions were related to power electronics architecture and design, avionics.

## Transformer UAV

The Transformer UAV project demonstrates a shapeshifting based approach to vertical-takeoff-and-landing (VTOL). The inspiration for this pursuit stems from designing a UAV that combines the efficiency of fixed-wing flight with the manuvarability of multi-rotor flight. Combined with the energy surplus associated with solar-powered flight yielded a unique and rich research pursuit. Protoypes are named MultI-Section-Transformable (MIST)-UAV.

## Sim-to-real Transformer UAV
<img align="left" width="700" height="700" src="/images/sim_to_real_1_compressed.jpeg">
While classical control techniques were used to successfully perform multiple transformations, many airframes were crashed in the process of testing controllers. A pursuit I am exploring is the use of reinforcement learning in controlling systems with challenging and unobservable dynamics. Currently exploring the use of AG-Tree from [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.05110](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.05110) with a larger action space for attitude and position control.
